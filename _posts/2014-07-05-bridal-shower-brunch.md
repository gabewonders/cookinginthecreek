Last Sunday was my big sister Nicole’s bridal shower. We held the party in my Mom’s backyard and it was a beautiful (hot) summer day. The bridal shower theme was brunch and, of course, I wanted to help with the food &amp; drinks and take the opportunity to try some new recipes. I must say, the food was absolutely delicious. The recipes I chose were new to me and I didn’t even have a chance to taste test anything before we put it out for everyone to eat. During the shower, Nicole’s soon-to-be Mother-in-law pulled me over to her and said, “Megan, something’s wrong with this French toast . . . ” My heart dropped, thinking “Oh no! I didn’t even test it, and for all I know it’s horrible.” Luckily, she was just teasing me and every dish was a hit with all the ladies. Not one bite was left over! I wanted to share some photos and the recipes that we made for the shower, because they were absolutely delicious! All the recipes can be made the night before and popped in the oven the next morning, which is great for events like this, or even during the holidays!

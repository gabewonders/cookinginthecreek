I made this pasta recipe last Friday night when Gabe and I had a couple friends over for what was supposed to be a Settler’s of CATAN game night, but turned into Sacramento in a box game night! It’s pretty much Monopoly with some added nostalgia for the four of us Sacramento natives.

This dish is more than just delicious. It’s you’ve gotta keep going back for seconds because you just want another taste of the amazing flavors, delicious. I don’t come across many recipes that I feel could be a go-to recipe, especially for entertaining, but I think I’ve definitely found one here. Now, in the beginning I almost didn’t pin this recipe when I discovered it on Pinterest because of the hefty amount of cream . . . but for a special occasion like this, that’s when I think “everything in moderation” is fine! I wouldn’t have this be a weekly meal, but every once in awhile, would make quite a treat!

Prep time: 15 minutes

Cook time: 25 minutes

Total time: 40 minutes

Yield: 4-6 servings

### Ingredients

8 ounces pappardelle pasta (Trader Joe’s has some dry for only $1.99)

2 tablespoons olive oil

1 red bell pepper, sliced

1 onion, thinly sliced

5 links sweet Italian chicken sausage, sliced

3 cloves garlic, minced

6 large mushrooms, sliced

pinch of red pepper flakes

1/2 cup cherry tomatoes

1 tablespoon fresh rosemary\*

1 cup heavy cream\*\*

1/2 cup sweet marsala wine

kosher salt

parmesan cheese for garnish

### Instructions

Bring a medium pot of water to a boil and add the sausages to cook for about 10 minutes to remove some of the fat, draining the water when finished. Place the sausages back in the pot with about a tablespoon of olive oil and brown both sides of the sausages. Once slightly browned, remove the sausages to a cutting board and slice them into bite-sized pieces.

Meanwhile, bring a large stockpot of water to a boil then generously salt with kosher salt. Add pappardelle pasta and cook until al dente (about 10 minutes) then drain, reserving 1/2 cup of the pasta water.

While pasta is cooking begin cooking the sauce. In a deep 10-inch skillet over medium-high, heat olive oil and then add the bell pepper and onion and cook for 4-5 minutes or until onion softens, stirring occasionally. Season with kosher salt, add mushrooms and cook for another 3 minutes. Add garlic, sausage and red pepper flakes and cook until the sausage and cook for another 2 minutes.

Add cream, marsala, tomatoes and rosemary to skillet and cook for about 3 minutes or until sauce thickens and tomatoes soften. Gently fold in pasta to skillet until coated. If you’d like more sauce, add reserved pasta water one tablespoon at a time or another pour or two of cream if you want a heavier sauce. Garnish with Parmesan, kosher salt and more rosemary if desired. Serve immediately.

Tips

\*If you don’t have rosemary handy, toss in fresh basil or even thyme to keep it on the savory side. An added sprinkle of parsley adds freshness before serving.

\*\*If you want to watch your cream intake, substitute it with 1/4 cup or so of mascarpone or another creamy cheese to help thicken the marsala sauce.

These savory corn muffins were the perfect complement to the [Slow Cooker Vegetarian Chili](http://cookinginthecreek.com/slow-cooker-vegetarian-chili/) that Gabe and I made last week. Nothing goes better with a warm bowl of hearty chili than a sweet and savory corn muffin. Dress it up if you like with a touch of butter and a drizzle of honey, for a sweet and savory side dish to your meal, or just enjoy as is!

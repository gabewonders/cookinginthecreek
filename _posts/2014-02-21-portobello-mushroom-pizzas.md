Pizza on mushrooms?! Sounds amazing and healthy too. Not to mention it’s Gluten free. It doesn’t get much easier to prepare, you just layer the sauce, cheese, and toppings on the mushroom and pop it in the oven and voilà, you’ve got a fun and tasty dinner or even lunch. Gabe and I both ate 2 mushrooms each, which was quite filling, surprisingly. I think the serving size may actually be one, but you would need something on the side to make it a full dinner, or you could just have two like us!

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Prep time: 10 minutes</span>

Cook time: 20 minutes

Total time: 30 minutes

Yield: 2 servings

### Ingredients

4 portobello mushrooms, stems removed (option to remove gills or not – I didn’t)

2 cups fresh spinach leaves

1 cup marinara sauce (I used Trader Joe’s Roasted Garlic Spaghetti sauce)

10 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese

¼ cup Parmesan cheese, finely shredded

1 tablespoon Italian seasoning

8-10 cherry tomatoes, sliced

5-6 olives, sliced (I used black, but kalamata would be good too)

Basil for garnish, julienned

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Place portobello mushrooms on a baking sheet stem side up. Fill the middle of each mushroom with spinach leaves, ¼ cup of the marinara sauce and a ¼ of the shredded mozzarella cheese and a sprinkle of the Parmesan cheese. Top with the Italian seasoning, sliced cherry tomatoes and the olives.

Bake for 15-20 minutes. Remove from the oven and garnish with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese, basil.

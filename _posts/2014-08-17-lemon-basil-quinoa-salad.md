This is another recipe Iâ€™ve made once or twice before, but it was pre-Cooking in the Creek. The other weekend some of our friends were having a BBQ at their house, and we wanted to bring something for everyone to share. This was a great addition to the delicious burgers and BBQ chicken they made. This quinoa salad has great flavor with the fresh lemon, basil and a variety of veggies. Any of the ingredients can be interchanged to your personal preference. Enjoy!

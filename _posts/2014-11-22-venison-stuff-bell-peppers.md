It’s the end of deer season. That means we now know whether there will be deer in the Thanksgiving stuffing or not. Although my dad did not get a deer of his own this year, lucky for him, his friend who doesn’t eat deer, was able to bag one. My dad, being the generous man that he is, gave Megan and I some ground venison to cook at home. We were pretty clueless about how to cook venison so I quickly went to the help of Google. I found a recipe for stuffed bell peppers and simply substituted the ground beef with venison. The bell peppers turned out great, the venison was much more lean than ground beef and of course anything cooked in garlic and covered in cheese tastes delicious. As venison is a little more rare to come by in the grocery store, feel free to use ground beef, ground turkey or ground bison. If you have the opportunity to try venison, I recommend it!

### Ingredients

4 large bell peppers

2 tablespoons of olive oil

1 medium yellow onion, diced

1 1/4 pounds of ground venison (or substitute with meat of your choice)

2 cloves garlic, minced

2 cups of cooked brown rice

1/2 cup of sour cream

1/2 cup of chopped green onions

1 cup of shredded Monterey jack cheese

salt and pepper, to taste

### Directions

Cut the bell peppers length wise, leaving the stems attached if possible. Remove the seeds inside the pepper. Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees. Heat a skillet to medium-high heat add olive oil, onions, salt and pepper, and cook for 1 minute. Next add ground venison, garlic, salt and pepper. Cook until meat is browned.

In a separate bowl mix the rice, sour cream and green onions. Add the ground venison to the mixture and combine thoroughly. Stuff the mixture into the peppers. Sprinkle each pepper half with as much cheese as you would like.

Place the stuffed peppers in a casserole dish, cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and continue to cook until heated through, about 15 minutes longer. Top with extra sour cream, green onions or salsa if you would like.

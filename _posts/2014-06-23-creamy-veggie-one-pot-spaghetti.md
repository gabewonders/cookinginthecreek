If you’re looking for an easy weeknight meal with whatever is lying around your kitchen, this is the right recipe for you! There’s many different one-pot pasta recipes out there, and you can pretty much tailor the recipe to any ingredients you have on hand. I happen to have zucchini and broccoli, but you could use mushrooms, bell peppers, artichokes, onions, olives, spinach, asparagus, and the list goes on! This particular recipe has a creamy sauce, just using a small amount of half and half with freshly grated parmesan cheese. The herbs give it a freshness that just brings the whole dish to life, that you’ll forget you made it all in one pot!

### Creamy Veggie One-Pot Spaghetti

Prep time: 5 minutes

Cook time: 15 minutes

Total time: 20 minutes

Yield: 4-6 servings


### Ingredients

6 1/2 cups water

12 ounces whole wheat spaghetti

2 zucchini, quartered and sliced

2 cups broccoli 3 garlic cloves, minced

3 sprigs fresh thyme, minced

1/3 <span style="color: #444444;">cup parmesan cheese, freshly grated</span>

1/4 cup half and half

<span style="color: #444444;">1/4 cup fresh basil, thinly sliced</span>

kosher salt and fresh ground pepper to taste

optional: sprinkle of hot red pepper flakes

*toppings: more parmesan cheese and fresh basil*

### Instructions

Bring the water to a boil in a large stockpot. If using whole wheat pasta, add the spaghetti first and allow to boil for 3 minutes before adding the zucchini, broccoli, garlic, thyme, salt and pepper. \*If using regular pasta, feel free to add ingredients all at once. (Whole wheat pasta tends to need a few minutes longer to cook than regular).

Once all the ingredients are added, reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until pasta is cooked through and liquid has reduced, about 8-10 minutes. Stir in parmesan, half and half, basil, and hot pepper flakes if desired. Feel free to add more salt and pepper to taste. Top with a sprinkle of parmesan and more fresh basil if desired. Serve immediately.

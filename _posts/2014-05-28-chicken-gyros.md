I’ve always loved a good gyro, but somehow I had yet to ever make them at home. Gabe picked out this recipe the other day, because he had a craving for Greek food. The chicken marinade was so tasty, that you could even just have the chicken by itself. But with all the delicious toppings, it makes them irresistible. We even got the tomatoes, cucumber and red onion fresh from the local farmer’s market that day. It was delicious!

### Chicken Gyros

<span style="color: #000000;">Prep time: 1 hour and 10 minutes</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Cook time: 20 minutes</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Total time: 1 hour and 30 minutes</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Yield: 4 servings</span>

### Ingredients

<span style="color: #000000;">1 lb boneless, skinless chicken (breasts or thighs)</span>  
<span style="color: #000000;">4 cloves garlic, crushed</span>  
<span style="color: #000000;">1 lemon, juiced</span>  
<span style="color: #000000;">2 teaspoons red wine vinegar</span>  
<span style="color: #000000;">2 tablespoons olive oil</span>  
<span style="color: #000000;">2 teaspoons dried oregano</span>  
<span style="color: #000000;">kosher salt and pepper</span>  
<span style="color: #000000;">12 oz. <span style="color: #000000;">tzatziki sauce (I used Trader Joe’s brand, or you can make your own)</span></span>  
<span style="color: #000000;">sliced tomatoes</span>  
<span style="color: #000000;">sliced onions</span>  
<span style="color: #000000;">sliced cucumbers</span>  
<span style="color: #000000;">lettuce</span>  
<span style="color: #000000;">4 <span style="color: #000000;">(pocketless) whole wheat pitas</span></span>

### <span style="color: #000000;">Instructions</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Whisk together the garlic, lemon juice, vinegar, oil, oregano, and 1 teaspoon salt in a small bowl and add to Ziploc bag. Add in chicken pieces and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour, turning halfway through.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Preheat the grill (or pan, I used a cast iron grill pan). Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper on both sides, and then grill until cooked through, about 8 minutes per side, depending what size/type chicken you are using. Allow the chicken to rest for a few minutes before slicing into strips.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Meanwhile, warm your pita bread. I just spray a pan with a little bit of coconut oil and warm each side of the pita for 1-2 minutes per side. Top the pita with the chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, and tzatziki.</span>

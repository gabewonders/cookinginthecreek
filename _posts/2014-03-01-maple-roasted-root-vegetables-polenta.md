This is a great recipe for all the winter vegetables in season right now! The vegetables are roasted in the oven with maple syrup and butter, combining sweet and salty flavors, which is always a delicious combination. Then, the roasted vegetables are served alongside creamy rosemary polenta. The polenta and vegetables can be served as dinner by themselves, or you could always cut down the portions and serve them as side dishes along with a nice piece of meat.

Prep time: 15 minutes

Cook time: 45 minutes

Total time: 1 hour

Yield: 4 servings

### Ingredients

**For the Polenta:**

2 1/4 cups water

2 cups milk

2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided

1 teaspoon salt

1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

1 cup dry polenta

1/3 cup parmesan cheese, finely grated

1 tablespoon fresh, chopped rosemary

**For the vegetables:**

1 large red onion, cut into eighths

1 pound brussel sprouts, halved

12 ounces pre-cut butternut squash, (or you can use one whole, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes)

1 small head cauliflower, cut into 1-inch florets

1 bunch winter radishes, washed &amp; cut in half

4 tablespoons pure maple syrup

3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided

Sea salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 400 F degrees.

On a large rimmed baking sheet, toss vegetables with 2 tablespoons melted butter and 1 tablespoon maple syrup. Season with sea salt and pepper. Roast for 30-40 minutes, turning vegetables every 10 minutes, until golden brown and softened. Remove from oven and toss with 1 tablespoons butter and 1 tablespoon maple syrup.

While the vegetables are roasting, make polenta. In a large saucepan, bring water, milk and 1 tablespoon butter to a boil. Add salt and pepper and whisk in the polenta. Whisk constantly for 3 to 4 minutes to prevent lumps. Simmer for 30 minutes, partially covered and stirring every 5 minutes, until the polenta is thick, smooth, and creamy.

Add parmesan and rosemary. Check for seasoning and adjust consistency by adding a bit of milk if too thick. Stir in 1 tablespoon of butter. If Polenta is ready ahead of time, keep covered until ready to serve.

Divide polenta between 4 bowls or plates, and top with 1/4 of the vegetables.

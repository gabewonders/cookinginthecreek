A lot of people have been asking lately how our blog is going, so I felt compelled this weekend to get a new post up, since it’s been awhile. I got home from the gym yesterday morning and decided to make a smoothie with the mass amounts of fruits and veggies that we got at Costco this past week. I think we may have overdone it a bit, which is easy to do when shopping at Costco. This is the first time I’ve used avocado in my green smoothie, and it really added a nice creaminess to it. I love getting in some vegetables in my first meal of the day if possible, so I made sure to add a big handful of power greens, which gives the smoothie a beautiful color. I was reading an article the other day that said don’t wait until the last meal of the day to get in your veggies, and I didn’t realize that I tend to do that. I always make sure of course to have fruit during the day, but sometimes forget about vegetables until dinner time. This smoothie is a great way to start your day and get your veggie count going early!

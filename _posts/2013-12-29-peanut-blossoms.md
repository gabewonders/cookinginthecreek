Here’s a Classic cookie recipe that I’m sure many people are familiar with. These cookies are heaven in my mouth, I love the combination of chocolate and peanut butter! After making these, I found myself wondering why I only make these at Christmas. These cookies would be wonderful all year round!

Prep time: 20 minutes

Baking time: 8 to 10 minutes

Total time: about 45 mins

Yields: about 48 cookies

(mine resulted in about 24 cookies because I used a 1 1/2 tablespoon cookie scoop)

### Ingredients

1 bag of chocolate kisses

1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour

1 teaspoon baking soda

1/2 teaspoon salt

1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened (1 stick)

1/2 cup creamy peanut butter

1/2 cup sugar, plus extra

1/2 cup brown sugar, firmly packed

1 egg

1 tablespoon milk

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Remove foil wrap from approximately 48 kisses (unless you make bigger cookies like I did).

Sift flour, baking soda, and salt together. In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and peanut butter, beat until fluffy. Add sugars, egg and milk and mix well. Add dry ingredients and mix well.

Shape dough into 1-inch balls use a teaspoon. Roll in sugar to coat. Place on ungreased cookie sheets.

Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until lightly browned. Remove from oven and gently press a candy kiss into each cookies. Cookies will crack around the edges.

Remove the cookie sheets to wire rack. Cool completely. Store in airtight container.

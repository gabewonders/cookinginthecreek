It’s your lucky day because we have two new recipes from Cooking in the Creek! Gabe and I have another wonderful recipe we wanted to share with you all. It’s named “The Best Banana Bread Ever!” My coworker brought in a loaf of this bread to the office a couple months ago and I’ve been wanting to try it out myself for awhile now, because it is definitely one of the best banana bread recipes I have ever tried. It has a crispy sugary crust and who can resist that! Give it a try the next time you have some ripe bananas laying around. You won’t be sorry 🙂

### The Best Banana Bread Ever!

Prep time: 20 minutes

Cook time: 55 minutes

Total time: 1 hour and 15 minutes

Yield: 1 loaf

### Ingredients

*\*Have all ingredients at room temp*

½ cup unsalted butter (1 stick)

1 cup granulated sugar

2 eggs (lightly beaten)

¾ to 1 cup mashed and very ripe bananas about (about 3 small bananas)

1 ¼ cup all-purpose flour

¾ teaspoon baking soda

½ teaspoon salt

½ cup nuts (optional – I like walnuts!)

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees and position rack in lower third of oven (this helps crisp the sugary crust).

Grease a loaf pan with butter and sprinkle with granulated sugar as if flouring a cake pan. Sprinkle an additional layer of brown sugar over the sugared pan on the bottom only.

In a stand mixer or with a hand mixer, beat the butter and sugar on high speed until light in color and texture (about 2 to 3 minutes).

Combine the flour, baking soda, and salt together in another bowl and whisk to combine.

Then, add the flour mixture to the butter and sugar mixture, and beat until the consistency of brown sugar. Gradually beat in the 2 large eggs.

Next, FOLD in the banana and nuts (if using), JUST until combined. Pour the mixture into your greased and sugared loaf pan. Now put another thin layer of brown sugar on top of the batter in the loaf pan.

Bake for 55 to 60 minutes, then check with a toothpick.

Cool in the pan for about 10 minutes and then turn out of the pan and cool on a rack.

Enjoy!

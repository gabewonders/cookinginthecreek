Lately, I’ve tried to get in the habit of taking Wednesday nights off from the gym, and coming straight home from work to try a new recipe. My hope is that the end product turns out good enough to post on the blog. Sadly not every recipe makes the cut. This week was a success though! I usually try to go to the grocery store on my lunch and get all the ingredients I need, so when I get home I can start the recipe and not have to rush. Cooking is much more therapeutic when you can do it at a leisurely pace. I had Gabe pick the recipe this week, because he always picks something I wouldn’t necessarily choose myself. This week was Mediterranean Turkey Burgers. The recipe is simple enough for a weeknight meal, and can easily be doubled for a crowd if you’re entertaining. The ingredients can be swapped to your taste and to whatever may be in stock in your kitchen. Καλή όρεξη! That’s “bon appétit” in Greek ; )

<span style="color: #2a2a2a;">In a large bowl, combine the turkey, spinach, olives, red onion, feta, garlic, oregano, egg, bread crumbs, salt and pepper. <span style="color: #1c1c1c;">It works well to squish the mixture with your hands. Then, s</span><span style="color: #1c1c1c;">hape the meat into six patties.</span></span>

<span style="color: #2a2a2a;">Cook the burgers on a cast iron grill pan or a grill if you’ve got one. Grill the burgers until cooked through (internal temperature 165 degrees). Spread the yogurt sauce on both sides of the bun, add the burger and top with thin slices of red onion, tomato, and cucumber. </span><span style="color: #000000;">Serve immediately!</span>

*<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Enchilada Sauce</span>*

2 1/4 vegetable broth

1/3 cup tomato paste

2 1/2 tablespoons chili powder

2 teaspoons ground cumin

1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano

2 â€“ 3 cloves garlic, minced

2 teaspoons soy sauce or tamari

1 tablespoon lime juice

*<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Filling</span>*

1 pound sweet potato (1 large or 2 small), chopped into nickel-size pieces

2 teaspoon olive oil

1/2 yellow onion, chopped

1 medium zucchini or yellow squash, grated on box grater (about 1 cup)

1 teaspoon chili powder

1/2 teaspoon ground cumin

1/2 teaspoon salt

2 cloves garlic, minced

1 1/2 cups cooked black beans\*

1 teaspoon maple syrup or agave syrup

A pack of corn or flour tortillas

Sliced avocado

Chopped fresh cilantro

*\*\*Or one 15 ounce can*

### Instructions

1\. Make enchilada sauce: Dump everything but the lime juice into a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer. Use a whisk or something and make sure that the tomato paste isnâ€™t just sitting in a clump. Let that simmer together for 10 to 15 minutes so that the sauce has time to thicken up a little. Add the lime juice and turn off the heat. Let it cool while you make the filling.

2\. To cook the sweet potato, grab a medium saucepan, fill it with an inch or two of water, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Throw in your metal steamer basket and fill that with the chopped sweet potato. Cover and steam until tender, 10-15 minutes. Dump into a bowl and smash the pieces around. Some chunks are fine, so you donâ€™t need to work too hard at making this smooth.

3\. While the sweet potato steams, grab a large skillet or wok and heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and saute until it begins to brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Toss in the squash and cook for another minute. Add chili powder, cumin, salt, garlic, and black beans. Cook together for another 2 minutes and then fold in the mashed sweet potato and maple syrup and turn off the heat. Mix until combined.

4\. Now to make the enchiladas, crank the oven to 375 degrees and grab a 9 X 13 baking dish.

5\. Cover the bottom of baking dish with about 1 1/2 cups of enchiladas sauce. Using griddle, your oven, or the microwave, warm up the tortillas. Dip a tortilla around in a little of the sauce in the baking dish so that the bottom is all coated. Fill the tortillas with a couple spoonfuls of filling, then roll it up and set it seam- side down in the dish. Keep going until you run out of space or out of filling.

6\. Cover the enchiladas with the remaining sauce, cover the dish tightly with foil, and throw it in the oven for 20 minutes. Take off the foil and cook it for 5 more minutes. Let it cook for a minute or two before serving. Feel free to top them with some sliced avocado or chopped cilantro.

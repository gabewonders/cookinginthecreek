Iâ€™m always looking for a good excuse to use our cast iron, and Megan found just the right recipe. This dish is extremely easy to cook and made for a colorful, warm, tasty dinner. When first reading this recipe I was a little worried that it would taste bland, but the variety of vegetables, browned butter and melted provolone cheese give the pasta great flavor!

Prep time: 10 minutes

Cook time: 35 minutes

Total time: 45 minutes

Yield: 4-6 servings

### Ingredients

2 cups whole wheat pasta, like penne

1 zucchini, chopped

1 cup grape or cherry tomatoes

1 small red onion, chopped

1 cup of corn, frozen or fresh off the cob if you have it

1 teaspoon minced garlic

2 tablespoons olive oil

1/2 teaspoon salt

1/2 teaspoon pepper

4 tablespoons unsalted butter

2 ounces freshly grated parmesan cheese

4 ounces freshly grated provolone cheese, or slices work too

fresh parsley for garnish

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Prepare water for pasta and bring to a boil. Once boiling, add pasta to cook. Drain when finished.

While pasta is cooking, heat a large oven-safe skillet, like a cast iron, over medium-low heat. Add in olive oil, then add in onions, zucchini, corn, tomatoes and garlic with salt and pepper, stirring to coat. Cook for 10-15 minutes, tossing occasionally, while softened.

While pasta and vegetables are cooking, heat a small saucepan oven medium heat. Add in butter and whisk constantly, stirring until bubbly and brown bits appear on the bottom, about 5-6 minutes. Remove and set aside.

Turn off heat under vegetables and add in pasta. Drizzle in brown butter and add in parmesan, stirring well to coat. Top with provolone, the place in the oven and cook for 8 minutes, just until cheese is melty. Remove and serve immediately, garnishing with parsley and extra cheese if desired.

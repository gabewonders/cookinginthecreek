Sitting down to watch the football game Megan and I noticed that we had not laid out a plethora of snacks for ourselves. Instead of simply ordering a pizza we decided to whip up an all time tasty snack of hummus and pita chips. This recipe is extremely simple. It only takes 10 minutes to whip up. Enjoy!

Total time: 10 Minutes  
Yields: 2 3/4 Cups (Note the picture above is 1/2 the recipe)

### Ingredients

4 garlic cloves  
2 cups canned chickpeas, drained, liquid reserved  
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt  
1/3 cup tahini (sesame paste)  
6 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice (2 lemons)  
2 tablespoons water or liquid from the chickpeas  
8 dashes hot sauce (we used Tabasco)

### Instructions

Turn on the food processor fitted with the steel blade and drop the garlic down the feed tube; process until itâ€™s minced. Add the rest of the ingredients to the food processor and process until the hummus is coarsely pureed. Taste, for seasoning, and serve chilled or at room temperature.

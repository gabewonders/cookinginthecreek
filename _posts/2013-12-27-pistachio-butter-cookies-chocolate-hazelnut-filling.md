It Christmas time! And what better way to spend the Saturday before Christmas, but making sweet treats! I found this recipe in one of my cookbooks, and it stood out to me because it’s different than any Christmas cookie I’ve ever made. It’s got all these different nutty flavors with the pistachios, almond extract and chocolate hazelnut spread, so I just had to try it! And man are they delicious!

Prep time: 35 minutes

Chilling time: 1 hour

Baking time: 15-18 minutes

Total time: about 2 hours

Yields: about 30 cookies

### Ingredients

1 cup unsalted butter, softened (2 sticks)

1/4 cup sugar

1 egg

1/2 teaspoon almond extract

2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted

3/4 pistachios, finely chopped

1 13 ounce jar chocolate hazelnut spread, (such as Nutella)

Confectioner’s sugar (for dusting)

### Instructions

In a large bowl, using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add egg and almond extract, beating to combine. Reduce mixer speed to low, add flour and mix until just combined. Add finely chopped pistachios and stir into batter.

Place dough on a clean work surface. Divide in half. Roll each piece into a log about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour or overnight.

Position the oven racks in the upper and lower third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.

Slice logs into 1/4 inch rounds thick. Place 1 inch apart on prepared baking sheets. Bake 15 to 18 minutes, until edges are golden brown. Rotate baking sheets for even baking. PLace cookies on wire rack to cool.

When cookies have completely cooled, spread about 1 teaspoonful of chocolate hazelnut spread on the bottom side on a cookies and top with another cookies, creating a sandwich. Repeat until all cookies have been assembled.

Dust cookies with confectioner’s sugar. Serve!

Megan and I bought a large bag of frozen Ono fish from Costco, but we had never really cooked Ono before and we were at a lost. The first couple times we tried it, the results were less than exciting, so we decided you canâ€™t go wrong with fish tacos! We found the below recipe, which really gives a flare to the usual fish taco recipes out there. These balsamic fish tacos have become a favorite of ours and I hope they become a favorite for you too.

Prep Time: 15 minutes

Cook Time: 15 minutes

Total Time: 30 minutes

Yield: 2 Servings

### <span style="font-size: 1.17em;">Ingredients</span>

1 tablespoon olive oil

1 tablespoon butter

2 Ono Fillets, cut into 1 inch pieces (you may substitute any other firm, white fish)

2 tablespoons [Creole Seasoning (make your own)](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/emerils-essence-recipe/index.html)

1/4 teaspoon Kosher salt

1/2 head green cabbage, coarsely chopped (you may substitute for red cabbage)

2 green onions, diced

1/2 cup Balsamic Salad Dressing

1 large tomato, seeded and diced

1 cups shredded Monterrey Jack cheese

4 small tortillas, warmed

### Instructions

In a large skillet, heat olive oil and butter over medium heat, until butter is melted. Toss Ono fillet pieces with [Creole seasoning](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/emerils-essence-recipe/index.html). Add to the skillet and cook over medium heat for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Sprinkle with salt. While fish is cooking, toss chopped cabbage and onion with the Balsamic Salad Dressing. Once combined, add to the skillet with the fish and continue stirring over medium heat until cabbage becomes tender and fish is completely cooked through (approximately 5 minutes). Remove from heat. Assemble the tortillas with shredded cheese, fish and cabbage mixture, and topped with diced tomatoes. Drizzle with additional Balsamic Salad Dressing, if desired.

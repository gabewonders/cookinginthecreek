I’ve been thinking about making my own trail mix for awhile now. There’s so many possible combinations I want to try! After Gabe and I went on a hike around Shell Ridge Open Space the other day, it got me thinking about finally making our own recipe of trail mix. We went to Trader Joe’s on the way back home, and they have such a great variety of ingredients for endless trail mix combinations. The mix we put together is slightly sweet and nutty, and addicting at first bite!

As you can probably tell, the blog has been suffering a bit lately. Maybe it’s something about spring time, and just wanting to spend time outdoors instead of cooped up in the kitchen, or maybe it’s just a busier time of year. Whatever it may be, we just haven’t been cooking many new recipes recently. But here is a mushroom chicken recipe we managed to cook up on a weeknight, that is super easy and has lots of fresh flavors! I also learned a fun fact, that Crimini mushrooms are baby portobello mushrooms, who knew?! The original recipe called for dry white wine, but I used Marsala wine since I already had it on hand and I thought it worked great. You can also feel good eating this dish because it’s made without any cream or butter, but isn’t lacking flavor with the fresh lemon, herbs and wine. Enjoy!

Prep time: 5 minutes

Cook time: 20 minutes

Total time: 25 minutes

Yield: 2 servings

### Ingredients

1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs

1 teaspoon olive oil

8-10 ounces crimini mushrooms, sliced

1/2 cup sweet marsala wine (or dry white wine)

1/2 chicken broth

2 cloves garlic, minced

2-3 sprigs fresh rosemary, plus extra for garnish

1 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (approx. 1 lemon)

salt and pepper

### Instructions

Sprinkle both sides of the chicken with salt and pepper. Heat oil in skillet over high heat and brown chicken on each side. Remove chicken breasts and set aside.

In the same pan, saute mushrooms for 2 minutes. Add chicken back to pan. Add wine, broth, garlic, rosemary, and lemon juice. Bring to a boil and allow to cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring garlic into sauce. Turn heat to low and cover pan with lid, allowing chicken to simmer for 8 minutes, or until cooked through.

Transfer chicken to plates. To thicken sauce, reduce it by simmering with the lid off for a few extra minutes, or stir in 1 tablespoon cornstarch dissolved in 1 tablespoon water. Remove rosemary sprigs and pour sauce over chicken. Garnish with fresh rosemary is desired.

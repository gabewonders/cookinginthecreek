Gabe and I picked this recipe today because we were looking for something delicious, of course, and yet didn’t require too many ingredients or time. We also wanted to pair this with an amazing salad recipe (that is soon to make an appearance on *Cooking in the Creek*). I have fond memories of eating Polenta every time I visited my Nonna. It’s an Italian staple! The taste of this Marinara sauce reminds me of hers, simple, classic and authentic Italian. The flavors of the cheesy polenta and the simplicity of the marinara make for a comforting dish that will make your taste buds sing! Buon Appetito!

*Me on my Nonna’s lap*

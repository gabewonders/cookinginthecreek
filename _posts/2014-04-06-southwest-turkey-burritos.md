Lately, it seems like every week has been busy and I just haven’t had much time to cook, so I’ve been going for any easy meal I can find. When Gabe and I were at Trader Joe’s the other week, they were sampling this ground turkey taco mixture topped with sour cream and cheese served with blue corn tortillas chips. The recipe only consisted of a few simple ingredients so I thought it’d be a perfectly easy weeknight meal!

Prep time: 5 min

Cook time: 10 minutes

Total time: 15 minutes

Yield: 4-6 servings

### Ingredients

1 pound ground turkey

4-6 whole wheat corn/flour tortillas

13 ounces salsa\*

4 ounces green chiles

6 ounces black olives, sliced

1 can black beans, cooked (optional)\*\*

taco seasoning

olive oil

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Optional toppings</span>

cheese, sour cream, avocado, lettuce, tomatoes, cilantro, lime, hot sauce.

\*I used Trader Joe’s Cowboy Caviar–it has corn, black beans and red bell pepper, with some spice!

\*\*The black beans are optional, if you’d like to add a little more protein to your burrito.

### Instructions

Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. When oil shimmers add turkey and cook, breaking up meat with the side of a spoon, just until meat is cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle the turkey with taco seasoning, just enough to lightly season the meat. Once cooked through, add the salsa, chiles, and olives. Cook until all the ingredients are warmed through.

Lastly, divide the meat mixture between each tortilla, add a spoonful of black beans (optional), and serve immediately with your favorite toppings!

This is another great soup recipe that’s really easy to make! I loved Campbell’s Tomato soup as a kid, but this soup is totally different, in a great way! I like to think of it as grown-up tomato soup with a twist! The addition of the saffron really adds a depth of flavor that I never would have imagined in tomato soup. The ingredients couldn’t be more simple either. Enjoy!

Prep time: 10 minutes

Cook time: 40 minutes

Total time: 50 minutes

Yield: 4-6 servings

### Ingredients

3 tablespoons olive oil

3 cups yellow onions, chopped (2 onions)

1 tablespoon minced garlic (3 cloves)

4 cups chicken stock

1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes, preferably San Marzano\*

Large pinch of saffron threads\*\*

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1/2 cup orzo

1/2 cup heavy cream

Grilled Cheese Croutons (see below)\*\*\*

### Instructions

In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions and cook over medium-low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until golden brown. Add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute. Stir in the chicken stock, tomatoes, saffron, 1 tablespoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Bring the soup to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, fill a medium pot with water, add a sprinkle of salt and bring to a boil. Add the orzo and cook for 7 minutes. (It will finish cooking in the soup.) Drain the orzo and add it to the soup. Stir in the cream, return the soup to a simmer and cook for 10 more minutes, stirring frequently.

Serve hot with Grilled Cheese Croutons scattered on top.\*\*\*

\*I used the whole peeled tomatoes, and it worked out, I just cut up the tomatoes separately.

\*\*Trader Joe’s has great prices on certain spices, and that’s where I got the saffron for this recipe, since it can be pretty pricey.

\*\*\*All you need for the croutons is your choice of sliced bread, cheese and butter. I used whole wheat, and white cheddar with provolone, but feel free to try any variety.

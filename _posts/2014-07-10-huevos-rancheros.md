On Saturday night, Gabe and I went to see the movie [Chef](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/chef_2014/) at the theatre. It was a great movie. Great looking food, great music, great story! If you’re going to see it don’t go to the theatre hungry. We had dinner beforehand and our mouths were still watering. It inspired me to make something absolutely delicious on Sunday for Brunch. I found this recipe for Huevos Rancheros with Roasted Sweet Potatoes and thought it was perfect! I already had a lot of the ingredients on hand from the [Fish Tacos with Slaw &amp; Lime Crema](http://cookinginthecreek.com/fish-tacos-slaw-lime-crema/) that I had made earlier in the week. The recipe amount could be stretched to feed four people, or two people for a very filling Brunch. I must say, the dish was absolutely amazing. Gabe said it was quite possibly the best thing I’ve ever cooked!

### Huevos Rancheros

Prep time: 15 minutes

Cook time: 45 minutes

Total time: 60 minutes

Yield: 2-4 servings

### Ingredients

1 medium Sweet Potato, peeled and cut into 1/4″ cubes  
1/2 medium yellow onion, diced  
1 tablespoon olive oil  
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika  
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder  
1/4 teaspoon onion powder  
1/4 teaspoon oregano  
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper  
1/4 teaspoon cumin powder  
1 15 ounce can black beans, drained and rinsed  
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice  
3 tablespoons cilantro, chopped  
4 corn &amp; wheat tortillas  
4 eggs  
1/2 cup crumbled cotija cheese  
Salt and Pepper to taste

*<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Toppings</span>: Avocado, Lime wedges, Fresh salsa, Cilantro*

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Toss cubed sweet potatoes, onions, and 1/2 tablespoon olive oil with the spices and a light sprinkle of salt. Spread in a single layer in a baking dish. Roast for 20-25 minutes until sweet potatoes are tender.
2. In a bowl, combine black beans, lime juice, cilantro and a light sprinkle of salt. Mash together and set aside.
3. When sweet potatoes are about done, heat 1/2 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet or cast iron pan to medium-low heat. Add tortillas and cook until they start to brown on one side. Flip, then divide the mashed beans between the tortillas, and crack 1 egg over the beans in each tortilla. Reduce heat to low, cover, and let cook until the egg whites are set. Sprinkle the eggs with salt and pepper.
4. To serve, plate the tortillas and divide the sweet potato mixture evenly among them. Sprinkle with cheese and salsa. Serve with avocado slices, lime wedges and cilantro, if desired.

<span style="color: #000000;">I think I’m in love with these tacos. When I told Gabe I was making meatless tacos, you might say he was less than enthused. Don’t get me wrong, I love a greasy carnitas street taco just as much as the next guy, but these tacos have so many fresh flavors going on, that you won’t even remember there isn’t any meat in there because your taste buds and your belly will be in heaven. These tacos are a combination of a few different recipes I came across, with a few elements from each to create one beautiful masterpiece. I think I will call them CALIFORNIA SUMMER TACOS! The grilled sweet potato acts as the meat substitute, giving you that hearty centerpiece to your taco, while the veggies add a freshness that only summer vegetables can provide, all topped with the most delicious creamy cilantro lime dressing. ¡Buen apetito!</span>

### <span style="color: #000000;">Instructions</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">*<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cilantro Lime Dressing</span></span>*</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Puree all ingredients in a blender or food processor until smooth. Taste and adjust seasonings if necessary.</span>

<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">*<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tacos</span>*</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Bring a large pot of well salted water to a boil. Boil peeled potatoes for 7-9 minutes or until slightly soft. </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Lightly oil grill pan with oil of your choice, I used coconut oil spray on a cast iron grill pan. Add potatoes spears to grill pan and cook over med-low heat for 6-8 minutes on each side checking periodically for browning. *(Optional: Lightly sprinkle potatoes with salt)*</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Meanwhile, in a heavy pan or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat, add the olive oil. Add the red onion and let it cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the corn and barely cook until tender, 2 minutes. Add the chilis, and jalapeño and stir. Season to taste with kosher salt and then add the cherry tomatoes, stir and pull off the heat immediately.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Heat the corn tortillas in a dry pan until hot and soft. Place one or two sweet potato spears in each tortilla. Spoon the corn mixture over the sweet potato spears. Add avocado chunks, a drizzle of cilantro lime dressing, fresh cilantro and a squeeze of lime juice over the tacos and enjoy right away!</span>

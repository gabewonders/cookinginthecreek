Are you ready for the most delicious and addicting cookie recipe ever? Well here it is! These cookies combine all the wonderful flavors that a mouthwatering cookie should have. I made these cookies for the second time a couple weeks ago for my parents annual Super bowl party. And may I say, they were a hit! Sadly I didn’t have any leftover to take home, so I’ll just have to make them again soon. I’ve discovered lately that brown butter adds a magnificent nutty flavor to cookies, and with the added caramel and sea salt to a classic cookie like the chocolate chip, it’s a recipe that will please any cookie lovers taste buds!

Prep time: 30 minutes

Cook time: 20 minutes

Total time: 50 minutes

Yield: about 22 cookies

### <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Ingredients</span>

1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, browned and cooled to room temperature

1¼ cup packed light brown sugar

¼ cup granulated sugar

2 eggs

2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

2¼ cups all-purpose flour

1 teaspoon baking soda

½ teaspoon sea salt

1 cup mini chocolate chips\*

12 caramels pieces approximately (cut in half)\*\*

Sea salt for sprinkling

### Instructions

To the brown butter, cut the butter into pieces and melt in a small saucepan over medium heat. Start to whisk constantly once the butter begins to foam (it can take quite a few minutes before this happens). As soon as the butter starts turning brown, fragrant and you see brown bits at the bottom of the pan, remove from heat immediately. Transfer to a mixing bowl and allow to cool.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare two cookie sheets lined with wax or parchment paper.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt.

In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the cooled butter and sugars on medium speed until well combined, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs and vanilla and beat until combined. Add in half of the flour mixture and mix on low speed until just combined. Add the rest of the flour and mix well. Stir in the chocolate chips by hand and stir until combined.

Using a small cookie scoop or tablespoon, scoop one tablespoon of dough, press the center with your thumb and fill with a half of a caramel piece. Place another scoop of dough on top and press together to seal the caramel inside. Place on cookie sheets.

Bake for 12-15 minutes or until the edges start to turn golden brown. Cool on baking sheet for two minutes and sprinkle cookies with sea salt. Transfer to cooling rack, and then devour!!

\*Feel free to use any size or type of chip that you like. This time I chose mini, but chunk or morsels would be great too!

\*\*I used Kraft caramels, and cut them in half. If you’d like you could also use caramel sauce if you’re feeling fancy!

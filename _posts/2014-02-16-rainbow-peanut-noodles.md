This recipe is a great weeknight dinner option and it’s vegetarian. Which I’m now realizing, most of the recipes I pick are vegetarian. It’s full of colorful and delicious fresh vegetables and the with the peanut sauce and whole wheat pasta, it definitely fills you up!

Prep Time: 20 minutes

Cook Time: 10 minutes

Total Time: 30 minutes

Yield: About 4-6 servings

### Ingredients

12 ounces whole-wheat pasta (I used spaghetti, but linguine would be good too)

1 tablespoon olive oil (or peanut oil)

1 red bell pepper, cored and julienned (thinly sliced)

1 yellow bell pepper, cored and julienned

2 medium carrots, peeled and julienned

1 cup Trader Joe’s Cruciferous Crunch (Kale, Brussel Sprouts, Broccoli, Green &amp; Red Cabbage)

1 cup shelled edamame

Toppings: thinly-sliced green onions, toasted sesame seeds and chopped peanuts

**Peanut sauce ingredients:**

1/2 cup creamy natural peanut butter

1/4 cup reduced sodium soy sauce

3 tablespoons water

2 tablespoons honey

2 tablespoons rice vinegar

1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger

2 teaspoons sesame oil

1 clove minced garlic

1 teaspoon sriracha hot chili sauce, or more to taste

### Instructions

**Peanut Sauce:**

Add all ingredients to a food processor or blender and pulse to combine. (Alternately: Whisk all ingredients together in a bowl by hand).

**Pasta:**

Cook pasta al dente in salted water according to package instructions.

Meanwhile, heat oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add bell peppers, carrots, cruciferous crunch, and edamame, and sauté for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Once the pasta is cooked, drain it and add the pasta and peanut sauce to the sauté pan of veggies and toss to combine. If the sauce is too thick, add a tablespoon or two of the pasta water until the sauce reaches your desired consistency.

Serve immediately, topped with scallions, sesame seeds and peanuts if desired.

This is another delicious recipe for your slow cooker that doesn’t require any pre-cooking. You can just toss all the ingredients into the slow cooker, turn it on and forget about it until you come home from a long day at work with your house smelling amazing and dinner all ready! This soup is so tasty! It’s not as spicy as I thought it may be with two jalapeños and cayenne pepper. It was just the right spice level for Gabe and I. We like spicy foods, but it wasn’t overbearing at all. It’s wonderful to finish off the soup with your favorite toppings, sour cream, cheese, green onions or tortilla chips for crunch! It makes for great leftovers and can be frozen too.

### Slow Cooker Chicken Tortilla Soup

Prep time: 15 minutes

Cook time: 6 hours

Total time: 6 hours and 15 minutes

Yield: 6 servings

### Ingredients

2 (15-ounce) cans diced tomatoes with green chilies, with juices

1 cup frozen corn

1 can (15 ounce) black beans, drained and rinsed

1-2 jalapeños, sliced

2 large boneless skinless chicken breasts

1 medium red bell pepper, chopped

1/2 teaspoon minced garlic

1/2 tablespoon chili powder

1 teaspoon cumin

1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper

3 cups chicken broth

Optional toppings: freshly shredded cheese, sour cream, tortilla chips, and green onions.

### Instructions

Spray a slow cooker with nonstick spray. Add the tomatoes with juices, corn, and black beans (drained and rinsed). Depending on your desired spice level, add 1 -2 jalapeños (leave seeds in for more heat and remove seeds for less heat). I used two jalapeños with the seeds and didn’t find it very spicy. Next, add the chicken, bell pepper, garlic, chili powder, cumin, cayenne, and chicken broth.

Stir everything together and cook on high for 3-5 hours or low for 6-8 hours.

When it’s finished, shred the chicken, stir it all together and serve!

Top each bowl with you favorite toppings and enjoy!

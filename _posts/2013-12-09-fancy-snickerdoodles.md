This cookie recipe could be great for your next holiday party or potluck, or even just to devour for yourself at home! I call them *Fancy Snickerdoodles* because they’ve got the same classic cinnamon sugar-coating as a snickerdoodle, but inside there’s a lovely surprise of rich flavors, from the brown butter, toasted pecans and oatmeal. Just make sure not to forget they’re in the oven like I did with my second batch! The extra crispy ones were still delicious, but cooking them for just about 10 minutes until the edges are slightly golden brown, makes for a delectable chewy interior! Enjoy!

Prep time: 30 minutes

Cook time: 10 minutes (per sheet)

Cooling time: 10 minutes

Total time: 50 minutes

Yields: About 2 dozens cookies

Ingredients

1 cup (2 sticks) butter, browned

1 cup whole pecans, toasted

1 cup quick one-minute oats

1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

1 teaspoon baking powder

1/2 teaspoon salt

1/2 cup sugar

1 cup brown sugar, packed

2 eggs

1 tablespoon vanilla extract

For the Rolling Mixture:

1/4 cup sugar

2 teaspoons cinnamon

Instructions

1\. Melt butter in a heavy bottomed sauce pan over medium to medium-high heat. Once the butter has melted and begins to foam, start whisking constantly. Once the butter is brown and has a nutty fragrance, transfer to a large mixing bowl to cool.

2\. Meanwhile, toast the pecans in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring frequently, for about 5-6 minutes until the pecans are dark brown and smell toasted. Immediately transfer to the bowl of a food processor. Add the oats and pulse until the oats and pecans are smooth and combined. Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl and whisk in the flour, baking powder and salt until well combined.

3\. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Then, add the sugar and brown sugar to the cooled brown butter and beat on medium to medium-high speed for 2-3 minutes. Add the eggs and vanilla and beat for another 2-3 minutes until well combined. Add the flour mixture and beat on low-speed until just combined.

4\. Use a medium (1 1/2 tablespoon) cookie scoop to form dough into balls, then roll in cinnamon sugar mixture. Place on a cookie sheet and bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes until edges just start to turn golden brown. Cool on a wire rack.

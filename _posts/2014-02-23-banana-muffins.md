These are probably the most delicious banana muffins I’ve ever made. And possibly ever had. I like to think they’re relatively healthy since they’re made with whole wheat flour and oat bran. You’re getting your whole grains, fiber, plus potassium from the bananas. I love the mixture of the different sugars, coconut, brown, and granulated. And just a touch of coconut sugar sprinkled on top gives the muffin top a nice sweet taste with a slight crisp. Everyone knows the muffin top is the best part! These are great for breakfast, or any time of day for a snack. Hope you enjoy them as much as we did!

Prep time: 10 minutes

Cook time: 18 minutes

Total time: 28 minutes

Yield: 12 muffins

### Ingredients

1 cup whole wheat flour

1 cup oat bran

1 teaspoon baking powder

1/2 teaspoon baking soda

1/4 teaspoon kosher salt

1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

1/4 cup organic coconut sugar, plus a little extra for sprinkling (I got mine from Trader Joe’s)

1/4 cup dark brown sugar

2 tablespoons granulated sugar

2/3 cup milk

3 tablespoons olive oil

1 egg

1 teaspoon vanilla

2 ripe bananas, mashed

1/2 cup pecans, chopped

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Line a twelve cup muffin pan with paper liners.

In a medium bowl, combine the first six ingredients. In a large bowl, whisk the next seven ingredient, coconut sugar through vanilla until well combined. Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients stirring until just combined. Mix in mashed bananas and pecans. Spoon the batter evenly into prepared muffin pan. Sprinkle each muffin top with just a pinch of coconut sugar. Bake for 16-18 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into centers of muffins comes out clean. Transfer to a wire rack to cool, and then eat! They are so delicious warm from the oven!

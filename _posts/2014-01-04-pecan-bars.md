[Pecan pie](http://cookinginthecreek.com/pecan-pie/) is one of mine and Gabe’s newly loved favorite pies. When I found this recipe I was excited to include it in my cookie lineup for the holidays! It’s basically [Pecan Pie](http://cookinginthecreek.com/pecan-pie/) in cookie form, with a lot of the same ingredients, but simpler and less time-consuming. Which was a definite plus, since I was making 3 different types of cookies in one afternoon! It’s a great recipe to mix up the usual holiday cookie selections, and they just melt in your mouth!

Prep time: 15 minutes

Baking time: 37-45 minutes

Total time: about 1 hour

Yield: 24-48 cookies (depending on how small/big you cut them)

### Instructions

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Crust</span>

1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened (1 stick)

1/2 cup brown sugar, packed

1 egg yolk

1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Topping</span>

1 cup brown sugar, packed

1/2 cup unsalted butter (1 stick)

1/4 honey

1/2 cup heavy cream

4 cups pecans, chopped

### Instructions

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Crust</span>

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a 9×13 inch baking pan with parchment paper, overlapping the sides of the pan with parchment. Butter the parchment with about 2 teaspoons of butter. Set aside.

In a large bowl, using an electric mixer on medium speed, cream butter and brown sugar together until light and fluffy. Beat in egg yolk. Slowly add flour and mix well.

Press dough into the prepared baking pan. Bake for about 12 to 15 minutes, until golden brown.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Topping</span>

In a large saucepan, stir the brown sugar, butter and honey together. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Stir constantly for 3 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in cream and pecans. Pour pecan mixture over the crust. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until bubbly. Cool in the pan on a wire rack.

Use the overlapping parchment to lift the cookies out of the pan and place on a cutting board. Cut into 24 bars and then cut each bar in half diagonally for triangles, if possible.

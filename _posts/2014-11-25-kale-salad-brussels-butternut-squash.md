Itâ€™s the potluck time of year, and at work last week we had a Thanksgiving themed potluck. People went all out! We had mashed potatoes, stuffing, cranberry sauce, autumn salads, spanish rice, pies, cakes, and two types of turkeys! (Smoked and Oven Roasted) It was amazing. I decided to bring this kale salad with brussel sprouts, roasted butternut squash topped with pomegranate seeds and candied pecans. It was the perfect addition to the potluck and added something healthy to the table of comfort food dishes. It was well received by my coworkers, some that actually had never tried kale before liked it! This salad is perfect for fall and would be the perfect addition to any Thanksgiving dinner table. Enjoy!

### Kale Salad with Brussels and Butternut Squash

Prep time: 45 minutes

Cook time: 1 hour and 15 minutes

Total time: 2 hours

Yield: 6 servings

### Ingredients

*<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pecans</span>*

*(Yields about 2 cups)*

1/4 cup granulated sugar

1/4 cup brown sugar

1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

1/2 teaspoon salt

2 cups unsalted pecans halves

1 egg white

1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

1 teaspoon water

*<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Salad</span>*

1 small butternut squash, peeled, seeds removed, and chopped into 1/2-inch cubes

1 tablespoon olive oil

Pinch of sea salt

1 small bunch Lacinato kale (Dino or Tuscan kale), chopped

1 pound brussels sprouts, sliced or chopped

1 cup pomegranate seeds (from one medium pomegranate)

1/2 cup candied pecans (see ingredient above and instructions below)

1/3 cup shredded Parmesan cheese

*<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dressing</span>*

1/4 cup olive oil

2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar

1 teaspoon Dijon mustard

1 small clove garlic, minced

2 teaspoons shallot, minced

Salt and black pepper, to taste

### Instructions

*<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pecans</span>*

Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.

In a medium bowl, add sugars, cinnamon, and salt. Whisk until combined. Set aside.

In a large bowl, whisk the egg white, vanilla, and water together until frothy. Add the pecans and gently toss until the pecans are well coated. Add the sugar and cinnamon mixture and toss until pecans are covered.

Spread the pecans out in a single layer on prepared baking sheet. Bake for about 40-45 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes. The sugar mixture will harden on the pecans.

Remove from the oven and let the pecans cool on the baking sheet. When completely cool, store in an airtight container.

*<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Salad</span>*

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place the butternut squash cubes on a large baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and toss. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Roast the squash for 25-30 minutes, stirring once, or until the squash is tender. Remove from the oven and set aside.

Place the kale in a large bowl and sprinkle with sea salt. Massage the leaves for 2-3 minutes, or until they soften and start to wilt. Stir in the chopped brussels sprouts, butternut squash, pomegranate seeds, candied pecans, and Parmesan cheese.

To make the dressing, whisk together the olive oil, apple cider vinegar, mustard, garlic, and shallot. Season with salt and black pepper, to taste.

Pour the dressing over the salad and toss well. Serve!

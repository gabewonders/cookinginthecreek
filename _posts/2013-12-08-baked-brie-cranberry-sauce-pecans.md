This is the perfect appetizer for the holidays! I’m sure after Thanksgiving or Christmas you might have some extra Cranberry sauce lying around, and what better way to use it up, but with some delicious oo-wee-goowee Baked Brie. Every year, I’m responsible for making the cranberry sauce at my parents house for Thanksgiving, and this year I decided to switch up the recipe and make it with pears and honey (instead of cane sugar). I linked the recipe below. I doubled the cranberry recipe, so there was a ton leftover which gave me the perfect opportunity to make this amazing appetizer! Enjoy!

 \*In the final picture, the recipe is doubled for a crowd.

Prep time: 5 minutes

Cook time: 15 minutes

Total time: 20 minutes

Yield: 6 servings

Ingredients

2/3 cup cranberry sauce

1 – 8 ounce brie round

1/3 cup toasted pecans pieces

Crackers for serving

Instructions

1\. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

2\. Remove the top of the rind from the cheese using a serrated knife, and discard the rind. Place the cheese, cut side up on an oven safe plate or bowl. Just make sure to use a larger plate or a bowl so your cheese doesn’t start oozing off the plate. Bake for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, toast the pecans in a pan for about 5-7 minutes on medium heat.

3\. Remove from the oven and top with the cranberry sauce. Bake for an additional 5 minutes, or until the cheese is soft and warm. Sprinkle the top with the toasted pecans.

4\. Serve immediately with crackers.
